# Changelog

All notable changes to sdbus-kotlin are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project aims to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-15

A maintenance release: refreshed external dependencies to their latest stable versions. There are
**no API or behavioral changes** — the public surface is byte-for-byte unchanged (both the JVM and
klib binary-compatibility dumps are identical to 1.0.0), so this is a drop-in upgrade.

### Changed — dependencies

- **Kotlin** `2.4.0` → `2.4.10` (toolchain; no klib-ABI shift).
- **kotlinx-coroutines** `1.10.2` → `1.11.0`.
- **kotlinx-atomicfu** `0.32.1` → `0.33.0`.
- **kotlinx-datetime** `0.7.1` → `0.8.0`.

### Documentation

- Describe the JVM backend by what it is (an owned junixsocket connection with a pure-Kotlin
  marshaller and dispatcher) rather than by what it no longer uses. (#152)

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-04

1.0 **freezes the public API.** It removes the names deprecated in 0.6.0 and lands a wave of
cross-backend behavioral parity fixes so the native (sd-bus) and JVM (junixsocket wire) backends
agree on the consumer-facing surface. Every fix ships with a cross-backend regression test.

### Removed (breaking) — the 0.6.0 deprecations

- **The fluent property layer** — `AsyncPropertyGetter`, `AsyncPropertySetter`, `AllPropertiesGetter`,
  `AsyncAllPropertiesGetter`, and the single-argument `Proxy.getPropertyAsync(propertyName)` /
  `setPropertyAsync(propertyName)` / `getAllProperties()` / `getAllPropertiesAsync()` factories that
  returned them. Use the direct typed accessors instead:
  `Proxy.getPropertyAsync<T>(interfaceName, propertyName)`,
  `setPropertyAsync(interfaceName, propertyName, value)`, `getAllProperties(interfaceName)`,
  `getAllPropertiesAsync(interfaceName)`.
- **`typealias Error`** — use `SdbusException` directly.

### Fixed — cross-backend parity (JVM backend)

- **Directed signals** now unicast-route on JVM; `Signal.setDestination` was broadcast. (#138)
- **Error name**: a handler throwing a non-`SdbusException` now surfaces
  `org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.Failed` on both backends — the JVM backend previously put the
  exception message in the error-name slot, and native produced `NoReply`. This changes the
  observable `SdbusException.name` for that case. (#142)
- **ObjectManager `InterfacesAdded` and no-argument `PropertiesChanged`** now carry the object's
  current property values on JVM (were emitted with empty maps). (#143)
- **Use-after-release**: JVM connection operations now throw the same error as native after
  `release()` instead of silently succeeding. (#144)
- **`proxy.release()`** now tears down the proxy's signal handlers on JVM (was a no-op). (#145)
- **Wrong argument count** → `org.freedesktop.DBus.Error.InvalidArgs` on JVM (was `UnknownMethod`);
  a genuinely-missing member stays `UnknownMethod`. (#146)
- **Same-process `Peer` (Ping/GetMachineId) and `Introspectable` (Introspect)** calls are now
  served on JVM (the local short-circuit returned `UnknownMethod`). (#147)
- **`JvmStaticDispatch`** dispatch table made thread-safe (data race between object
  registration and concurrent dispatch). (#148)
- **`dontExpectReply`** (fire-and-forget calls) honored on JVM — no ~30s wait for a reply, and no
  error surfaced for a missing target. (#149)
- **`Connection.addMatch`** with a well-known `sender=` now receives matching signals on JVM
  (the local re-filter was dropping them). (#150)

### Added

- Serve-worker-pool saturation watchdog for non-compensated nested blocking. (#133)
- Substantial external-integration test coverage of the 0.6.0 surface and the cross-backend
  contracts, plus a coverage baseline at [`docs/TEST_COVERAGE.md`](docs/TEST_COVERAGE.md).
  (#134–#136, #139)

See [`docs/BACKENDS.md`](docs/BACKENDS.md) for the small set of same-process / direct-connection
differences that remain documented rather than matched (none on the cross-process path).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-18

0.6.0 is the **1.0-polish** release. A post-0.5.0 review of the public surface (epic #108)
produced a coordinated cleanup wave — renames, deprecations, and a few new first-class APIs —
so that 1.0 can ship a final, well-named surface. It also lands several real bug fixes found
along the way.

Deprecations introduced here are kept as warnings for this release and **removed at 1.0**.
(Note: the 0.5.0 changelog called itself the "1.0 API-freeze"; the post-0.5.0 review reopened a
handful of names, so 0.6.0 is the last shaping pass and **1.0** is the actual freeze.)

This entry is the migration guide. Most breaking changes are renames with identical behavior.

### Bug fixes

Memory leaks in served objects and connections (#119) — both backends:
- Every served object leaked after `release()`: the native vtable teardown never dropped the
  registered method/property/signal callbacks (which capture the adaptor), and on the JVM the
  `Properties` dispatch handlers were never unregistered from the process-wide dispatch table.
  A property-bearing served object (the common BlueZ case) leaked for the process lifetime.
- Native connections leaked once objects/signal subscriptions were registered: several cleanup
  closures captured the connection (`this@ConnectionImpl`) via member access and were retained
  by their GC cleaner. Fixed at five sites. (The compiler's non-capturing-`createCleaner` check
  cannot catch this because the capture launders through a `Reference` parameter.)

Native event-loop thread starvation (#128) — connection event loops shared one bounded 8-thread
pool, so more than 8 concurrently-running loops would starve (a served object whose loop never
got a thread could not answer calls). Each connection now gets its own dedicated loop thread.

### Breaking changes

Naming sweep (#113) — behavior-identical renames, **no compatibility aliases** (update call sites):
- `acall` → `asyncCall`, `createACall` → `createAsyncCall` (vtable method DSL; generated adaptors regenerated).
- `SdbusSig` → `TypeSignature` (in `Variant.get`/`Typed`/`signatureOf`/property accessors).
- `Message.path` → `Message.objectPath`.
- `SignalEmitter.typedMethodArguments` → `arguments`; `SignalSubscriber.methodCall` → `handler`.
- `PlainMessage.Companion.createPlainMessage()` → top-level `createPlainMessage()` (matches `createObject`/`createProxy`).
- `Flags.test(flag)` → `Flags.has(flag)`; also adds an `in` operator (`flag in flags`).
- `Connection.addMatchAsync(...)` — **removed** (had no users; the async match-install machinery is gone too). Use `addMatch`.
- `MethodReply`'s accidentally-public constructors — now `internal`.

`requestName` now reports its outcome and accepts flags (#112):
- `fun requestName(name: ServiceName)` → `fun requestName(name: ServiceName, vararg flags: RequestNameFlag): RequestNameReply`.
- New `enum RequestNameFlag { ALLOW_REPLACEMENT, REPLACE_EXISTING, DO_NOT_QUEUE }` and
  `enum RequestNameReply { PRIMARY_OWNER, IN_QUEUE, EXISTS, ALREADY_OWNER }`.
- Source-compatible: `requestName(name)` still compiles (the return is simply now ignorable). Behavior
  note: requesting a name already owned by another peer now **queues** by default and returns `IN_QUEUE`
  on both backends (the native and JVM flag handling were made consistent), rather than throwing — pass
  `DO_NOT_QUEUE` to fail fast with `EXISTS`.

fd-based connection factories are native-only (#111):
- `createDirectBusConnection(fd: UnixFd)` and `createServerBusConnection(fd: UnixFd)` are removed from the
  common (multiplatform) surface — they were `@Deprecated(level=ERROR)` JVM stubs — and are now plain
  native-only functions. Address-based `createDirectBusConnection(String)` stays common.

Mechanical reductions (#116):
- `Resource` now extends `AutoCloseable` (usable in `use { }`; `close()` delegates to `release()`).
- `Typed`, the VTable item types, etc. are no longer `data` classes (no `copy()`/`componentN()`).
- `Flags.Count`, `maybeDegrouped`, and `PropertyDelegate.name` are removed/internalized.

### Deprecations (removed at 1.0)

- `Error` → renamed `SdbusException` (#109). `Error` remains as a deprecated `typealias` (source-compatible; warns).
- The fluent property layer (#110) — `AsyncPropertyGetter`/`AsyncPropertySetter`/`AllPropertiesGetter` and their
  `onInterface`/`toValue`/`getResult` chains are deprecated in favor of the new direct accessors below.

### New API

- `SdbusException` (the renamed exception type).
- `RequestNameReply` / `RequestNameFlag` (see `requestName` above).
- Direct typed property accessors (replacing the fluent layer): `suspend Proxy.getPropertyAsync<T>(iface, prop)`,
  `suspend Proxy.setPropertyAsync<T>(iface, prop, value)`, `Proxy.getAllProperties(iface)`,
  `suspend Proxy.getAllPropertiesAsync(iface)`.
- `Object.notifying(iface, prop, initial): ReadWriteProperty` — a property delegate that emits
  `PropertiesChanged` on change (skipping no-op sets).
- `createObject(connection, objectPath, runEventLoopThread = true)` — server-side event-loop symmetry with
  `createProxy`; `startEventLoop()` is now idempotent. Source-compatible (the parameter defaults).
- `Flags.has(flag)` and the `flag in flags` operator.

### Behavioral improvements

- Generated adaptors now auto-emit `PropertiesChanged` (#115), honoring the
  `org.freedesktop.DBus.Property.EmitsChangedSignal` annotation — a remote `Set` or a server-side set both emit,
  so clients' property-change flows fire by default.
- The JVM serve worker pool is now bounded and deadlock-free under nested same-connection calls (#101),
  replacing the previously-unbounded cached thread pool.

### Docs

- KDoc cleanup (#117): removed stale sdbus-c++ doxygen (`@class`/`@c`/`std::future`/C++ examples) from the public
  surface and fixed the public dokka "couldn't resolve link" warnings.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-13

0.5.0 is the **1.0 API-freeze** release. It does two big things:

1. **Freezes the public API.** A coordinated wave of breaking changes renamed and
   reshaped the public surface so that what 0.5.0 ships is the API 1.0 will ship.
   The surface is now enforced in CI with
   [binary-compatibility-validator](https://github.com/Kotlin/binary-compatibility-validator)
   (JVM `.api` and klib `.klib.api` dumps under `api/`).
2. **Rewrites the JVM backend.** The JVM target no longer uses
   [dbus-java](https://github.com/hypfvieh/dbus-java). It now owns its D-Bus
   connection — junixsocket transport plus a pure-Kotlin marshaller and dispatcher —
   mirroring the native sd-bus backend, including cross-process serving and unix-fd
   passing. The `dbus-java` runtime dependency is gone from the published `-jvm`
   artifact (junixsocket remains).

This entry is the migration guide. Most breaking changes are renames or reshapes with
identical behavior; the old → new mappings below are what you need to update call sites.

### Breaking changes

Public async API (#57, issue #38):
- Callback-style `Proxy.callMethodAsync(MethodCall, (reply, error?) -> Unit)` — **removed** from the public API. The suspend form is now the only public async contract; use `suspend Proxy.callMethodAsync(...)`.
- `PendingAsyncCall` and the `AsyncReplyHandler` typealias — now `internal`.

Signature / error / VTable internals (#57, issues #40/#41/#42/#45):
- `createError(errNo, customMsg)` — now `internal`; construct `Error(name, message)` directly.
- The `SdbusSig` hierarchy (`PrimitiveSig`, `ListSig`, `MapSig`, `StructSig`, `InvalidSig`), all top-level `*Sig` vals, and `SerialDescriptor.asSignature` — now `internal`. `SdbusSig` itself stays public as an opaque handle; `signatureOf<A>()`, `typed<A>()`, and the `call`/`args` DSL are unchanged.
- The native cinterop `MethodCall.send(handler, scope, ULong)` overload — now `internal`.
- VTable builder item types (`MethodVTableItem`, `PropertyVTableItem`, `SignalVTableItem`, `InterfaceFlagsVTableItem`, `SignalEmitter`, `TypedMethod`, `TypedArguments`, `TypedMethodCall.SyncMethodCall`, `TypedMethodCall.AsyncMethodCall`) — no longer `data` classes (no `copy()`/`componentN()`). The `addVTable { ... }` DSL is unchanged.

Timeouts unified on `kotlin.time.Duration` (#58, issue #37):
- `Proxy.callMethod(MethodCall, ULong)` → `Proxy.callMethod(MethodCall, Duration)`.
- `suspend Proxy.callMethodAsync(MethodCall, ULong)` → `... (MethodCall, Duration)`.
- `MethodCall.send(ULong)` → `MethodCall.send(Duration)`.
- All raw `ULong`-microsecond timeout overloads are removed from the public surface. `Duration.ZERO` still means "use the connection default".

`Message` accessors are now typed `val` properties (#59, issue #44):
- `getDestination(): String?` → `val destination: BusName?`
- `getSender(): String?` → `val sender: BusName?`
- `getInterfaceName(): String?` → `val interfaceName: InterfaceName?`
- `getMemberName(): String?` → `val memberName: MemberName?`
- `getPath(): String?` → `val path: ObjectPath?`
- `getSELinuxContext()` → `val seLinuxContext`; `getCredsPid()/getCredsUid()/...` → `val credsPid/credsUid/...`
- `peekType(): Pair<Char?, String?>` → `fun peekType(): PeekedType` (named result with `type`/`contents`).
- `Signal.setDestination(String)` → `setDestination(BusName)`.

`UnixFd` and connection factories (#60, issues #48/#43):
- `UnixFd(fd, Unit)` adopt-without-dup constructor → `UnixFd.adopt(fd: Int)` factory. `UnixFd(fd)` still dups by default.
- `createServerBus(fd)` → `createServerBusConnection(fd: UnixFd)`.
- `createDirectBusConnection(fd: Int)` → `createDirectBusConnection(fd: UnixFd)`.
- `createSessionBusConnectionWithAddress(String)` → `createSessionBusConnection(address: String)` (overload).
- `createProxy(..., dontRunEventLoopThread = false)` → `createProxy(..., runEventLoopThread = true)` (flag flipped to a positive name; default behavior unchanged).

Property-delegate flows (#61, issue #46):
- `PropertyDelegate.flow()` → `values()`; `flowOrNull()` → `valuesOrNull()`. `changes()`/`changesOrNull()` are unchanged. (`values*` = current value first, then changes; `changes*` = change events only.)

Naming sweep (#62, issue #49):
- `Connection.enterEventLoopAsync()` → `startEventLoop()`; `suspend leaveEventLoop()` → `suspend stopEventLoop()`.
- `Connection.getUniqueName()` → `val uniqueName`; `getMethodCallTimeout()/setMethodCallTimeout(Duration)` → `var methodCallTimeout`. (Remote calls such as `PeerProxy.getMachineId()`, `PropertiesProxy.getAll()`, `ObjectManagerProxy.getManagedObjects()`, and property `get`/`set` stay methods.)
- Duplicate top-level/companion `DBUS_PROPERTIES_INTERFACE_NAME` constants removed; the canonical home is `PropertiesProxy.INTERFACE_NAME`.
- `PropertiesProxy.onPropertiesChanged` hook removed; supply the callback to `registerPropertiesProxy(onPropertiesChanged = ...)` instead.

Platform-specific surface (#87, issue #82):
- `createRemoteSystemBusConnection` is now **native-only** (removed from the JVM/common API, where it was a no-op-ish mis-declaration).

### Added

- `UnixFd.adopt(fd: Int)` — take ownership of a descriptor without dup'ing (#60).
- `PeekedType` — named result type for `Message.peekType()` (#59).
- `PropertyDelegate.values()` / `valuesOrNull()` (#61).
- **JVM owned D-Bus connection** (issue #93, landed across phases #94–#103): pure-Kotlin
  byte marshaller (#94), junixsocket transport with SASL EXTERNAL framing (#95), client
  path (#96), wire signal emission (#99), cross-process serving of methods / properties /
  introspection (#100), and SCM_RIGHTS unix-fd passing (#102). Phase 6 (#103) made the
  owned connection the JVM backend and retired dbus-java.
- Independent-peer test coverage against [python-dbusmock](https://github.com/martinpitt/python-dbusmock) (issues #70/#73/#75/#76) and a server-side sample, `samples/demo-service` (#88).
- Documentation: a backend parity matrix at `docs/BACKENDS.md` (#79, #91) and a rewritten README (#77).

### Behavior changes

- **JVM backend no longer depends on dbus-java** (issue #93). The published `-jvm`
  artifact drops the `dbus-java-core` / `dbus-java-transport-junixsocket` runtime
  dependencies; junixsocket remains. Application code is unchanged.
- JVM strict reply deserialization, call-after-release now throws, and errno → D-Bus
  error-name mapping pinned to native output, for JVM ↔ native parity (#63, issue #56).
- JVM honors `Connection.methodCallTimeout` and now throws when the bus is unreachable
  instead of silently falling back to an in-process stub (#85, issues #80/#81).

### Fixed

- JVM wire fixes: struct marshalling, foreign (non-sdbus) error names, and grouped /
  multi-out replies now round-trip correctly against real peers (#78, issues #71/#72/#74).
- Native heap-corruption race fixed by taking the `SdBus` lock in
  `sd_bus_message_new_method_return` — root cause of the long-standing ARM async flake
  (#86, issue #84).
- Generated adaptor property getters now serialize the value, so a remote
  `Properties.Get` works on native (#104, issue #89).

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-03

- Native async/event-loop stability: run the event loop on a dedicated dispatcher,
  serialize async slot unref through the `SdBus` lock, and fix several startup/exit races
  (including the ARM async integration test).
